# Codex Examples Library

Collection of example scripts demonstrating common workflows and best practices.

## Quick Start

All examples are executable bash scripts. Make them executable first:

```bash
chmod +x examples/*.sh
```

## Examples Overview

### 01 - Quick Task Execution
**File:** `01-quick-task.sh`
**Focus:** Basic synchronous task execution
**Use Case:** Quick fixes, file listings, simple edits
**Runtime:** < 30 seconds

Demonstrates:
- Using default reasoning levels
- Real-time output streaming
- Quick experiments and iterations

---

### 02 - Research Workflow
**File:** `02-research-workflow.sh`
**Focus:** Web-enabled research with structured reports
**Use Case:** Technology research, comparisons, documentation discovery
**Runtime:** 1-3 minutes per topic

Demonstrates:
- Single and batch research tasks
- Web search integration
- Structured markdown reports
- Citation management

---

### 03 - Parallel Background Workers
**File:** `03-parallel-workers.sh`
**Focus:** Running multiple tasks concurrently
**Use Case:** Independent tasks, code analysis, batch processing
**Runtime:** Depends on task complexity

Demonstrates:
- Launching parallel workers
- Process ID tracking
- Waiting for completion
- Status monitoring

---

### 04 - Mixed Reasoning Levels
**File:** `04-mixed-reasoning-levels.sh`
**Focus:** Choosing appropriate reasoning levels
**Use Case:** Optimizing speed vs quality tradeoff
**Runtime:** ~2-3 minutes total

Demonstrates:
- minimal: 5-10s (trivial tasks)
- low: 10-15s (simple tasks)
- medium: 15-25s (moderate complexity)
- high: 30-60s+ (complex analysis)

---

### 05 - Sequential Pipeline
**File:** `05-sequential-pipeline.sh`
**Focus:** Chaining dependent tasks
**Use Case:** Multi-step workflows, project scaffolding
**Runtime:** 3-5 minutes

Demonstrates:
- Research → Design → Plan → Execute workflow
- Task dependencies
- Appropriate reasoning per step
- Building complex workflows

---

## Running Examples

```bash
# Run a specific example
./examples/01-quick-task.sh

# Run all examples (may take 10-15 minutes)
for script in examples/*.sh; do
    echo "Running $script..."
    bash "$script"
    echo "---"
done
```

## Best Practices Learned

### 1. **Choose Reasoning Wisely**
- Start with `low` for unknown tasks
- Use `minimal` for batch operations
- Reserve `high` for architecture/complex problems

### 2. **Parallel vs Sequential**
- **Parallel:** Independent tasks (code analysis, research)
- **Sequential:** Dependent tasks (research → design → implement)

### 3. **Monitoring**
- Use `codex-status.sh` to check job progress
- Background workers save logs with timestamps
- Check exit codes for error handling

### 4. **File Organization**
- Research outputs: `.mahirolab/research/`
- Worker outputs: `.mahirolab/workers/`
- Custom outputs: configurable via `output_type`

## Creating Your Own Examples

Template for new examples:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example N: [Title]
# [Brief description]

echo "=== Example N: [Title] ==="
echo ""
echo "[Detailed description]"
echo ""

# Your codex commands here
./codex-exec.sh "Your task"

echo ""
echo "✅ Example completed!"
echo ""
echo "💡 Tips:"
echo "  - [Tip 1]"
echo "  - [Tip 2]"
```

## Next Steps

- Review `CLAUDE.md` for architecture overview
- Check `codex.yaml` for configuration options
- Use `--help` flag on any script for detailed usage
- Combine examples to create custom workflows

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Permission denied
**Fix:** `chmod +x examples/*.sh`

**Issue:** codex command not found
**Fix:** Ensure Codex CLI is installed and in PATH

**Issue:** Slow performance
**Fix:** Lower reasoning level or reduce parallel workers
