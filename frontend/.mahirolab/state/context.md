# Session Context

**Date:** 2025-10-06 22:21
**Session ID:** 20251006_2221

## Goals
- Complete form validation system with React Hook Form and Zod (Phase 2)
- Fix all TypeScript compilation errors
- Refactor codebase to follow kebab-case naming conventions
- Ensure SSR compatibility with Lingui i18n macros

## Completed
- ✅ Installed form validation dependencies (react-hook-form, zod, @hookform/resolvers)
- ✅ Created validation schemas (transaction.schema.ts, goal.schema.ts) with custom refinements
- ✅ Built reusable form components (FormInput, FormSelect, FormError)
- ✅ Implemented TransactionForm with category filtering
- ✅ Implemented GoalForm with live progress preview
- ✅ Fixed SSR compatibility issues (vite-plugin-babel-macros, ESM compilation)
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors (Zod v4 syntax, generic annotations)
- ✅ Added missing cn.ts utility (clsx + tailwind-merge)
- ✅ Renamed hooks to kebab-case (useGoals → use-goals, etc.)
- ✅ Tested forms visually with Playwright MCP
- ✅ Created retrospective document
- ✅ Committed all changes with proper conventional commit format

## Decisions Made
1. **Zod v4 over v3**: Updated to latest Zod version despite breaking changes in error message syntax (required_error → message)
2. **vite-plugin-babel-macros**: Chose this plugin over @vitejs/plugin-react for Lingui macro support in SSR mode
3. **Runtime i18n for hooks**: Used `_()` from `@lingui/react` instead of `t` macro for dynamic translations in use-fetch-error hook
4. **Kebab-case convention**: Applied across all custom hooks for consistency with component naming
5. **No .default() in schemas**: Removed `.default(0)` from Zod schema to avoid TypeScript inference conflicts

## Current Status
Phase 2 (Form Validation System) is **complete and committed**. All TypeScript errors resolved. 7 commits ahead of origin/main, ready to push.

Dev servers running:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 ✅
- Backend: http://localhost:3000 ✅

## Next Steps
- [x] ~~Phase 3: Performance Optimization~~ **CANCELLED** (2025-10-06)
  - Reason: Premature optimization, React 19 already optimized, low ROI
  - Research: Confirmed React 19 doesn't have auto-memoization without Compiler
- [ ] **Priority 1:** Translate validation error messages to Thai
  - Technical debt from Phase 2
  - Improves UX for Thai users
- [ ] **Priority 2:** Push commits to remote repository
  - 7 commits ahead of origin/main
  - Clean up git state
- [ ] **Priority 3:** Phase 4 - Testing Infrastructure (optional)
  - Setup Vitest
  - Write tests for validation schemas
  - Add component tests
- [ ] **Priority 4:** New features (if any)

## Blockers/Issues
- None currently. All technical issues from Phase 2 have been resolved.
- Phase 3 cancelled due to premature optimization concerns.
