## ðŸ”´ Critical Safety Notice
**All helper scripts invoke `codex exec` with `danger-full-access`, granting unrestricted system permissions.**
- Run only inside isolated development environments that you control.
- Keep secrets, credentials, and private data out of scope for any Codex job.
- Consider adding allowlists or permission guards before sharing these scripts with others.
- Inspect everything Codex writes under `.mahirolab/**` in case unexpected files or code appear.

## Core Idea: Direct Process Execution
Replacing `tmux send-keys` with direct `codex exec` calls makes automation faster, more reliable, and easier to integrate with tooling.
- No terminal emulation latency or timing hacks.
- Clean access to stdout/stderr plus exit codes for precise scripting.
- Natural fit for CI/CD pipelines or higher-level orchestrators.

### Baseline `codex exec` Usage
```bash
# Run directly with an explicit reasoning level
codex exec -s danger-full-access -c model_reasoning_effort="low" "Describe the task here"

# Examples
codex exec -s danger-full-access -c model_reasoning_effort="high" "Refactor the API to use TypeScript interfaces"
codex exec -s danger-full-access -c model_reasoning_effort="low" "List all files in src/"
```

### Reasoning Level Cheat Sheet (approximate runtimes)
- `minimal` â€“ fastest (~5-10s) for trivial tasks.
- `low` â€“ balanced speed and depth (~10-15s).
- `medium` â€“ default choice for moderate complexity (~15-25s).
- `high` â€“ deepest reasoning for large refactors or analyses (~30-60s+).

## Architecture Overview
Three bash wrappers tailor `codex exec` to complementary workflows:
1. **Direct execution** for immediate, synchronous tasks.
2. **Research mode** that enables web search and enforces a structured report.
3. **Background workers** that keep long jobs running while persisting logs with process identifiers.

## Helper Scripts

All scripts located in `.mahirolab/bin/`

### `codex-exec.sh`
- **Role:** Thin wrapper for on-demand, synchronous commands.
- **Usage:** `.mahirolab/bin/codex-exec.sh [reasoning_level] "task"` (single argument defaults to `low`).
- **New Features:**
  - `--dry-run` / `-d` - Preview command without executing
  - `--help` / `-h` - Comprehensive help with examples
  - `--version` / `-v` - Show version information
- **Behavior:** Prints colorized status, forwards the prompt to `codex exec`, and always enables `danger-full-access`.
- **Output:** Streams stdout/stderr to the console without saving filesâ€”ideal for quick experiments you want to supervise manually.
- **Ad-hoc backgrounding:** Append `&` to launch in the background (for example, `./codex-exec.sh high "Analyze large dataset" &`) and manage the job yourself with `jobs`, `wait`, or `tail`.

### `codex-research.sh`
- **Role:** Research assistant that turns on the `web_search` tool and captures results.
- **Usage:** `./codex-research.sh "research topic"` (required argument).
- **Behavior:**
  - Sanitizes the topic into a slug, prepends a timestamp, and ensures `.mahirolab/research/` exists.
  - Supplies a fixed prompt template enforcing sections such as Executive Summary and Key Findings, plus plain-URL citations.
  - Forces `model_reasoning_effort="medium"` and runs with `danger-full-access`.
- **Output:** Markdown report saved once Codex honors the `Save output to:` instruction (the agent replaces `PLACEHOLDER` with its own PID).
- **Follow-up:** Review the generated file in `.mahirolab/research/` to validate citations, section order, and completeness before sharing.

### `codex-worker-launcher.sh`
- **Role:** Background orchestrator that embeds the originating Bash PID in the final filename.
- **Usage:**
  - Full form: `./codex-worker-launcher.sh [reasoning_level] [output_type] "task"`.
  - Shorthand: `./codex-worker-launcher.sh "task"` (defaults to `low` reasoning and `workers` output type).
- **Behavior:**
  - Creates a timestamped temp file under `.mahirolab/<output_type>/`.
  - Spawns `codex exec` in a subshell, captures the Bash PID, and waits for the agent to write the temp file.
  - Renames the file to `<timestamp>_<bashpid>_codex_task.md` for traceability once writing finishes.
- **Suggested monitoring pattern:**
  1. Launch the worker and note the printed Bash PID.
  2. Avoid polling until a user or downstream system requests results.
  3. When prompted, open or tail the persisted file to inspect progress or the final log.
  4. Optionally verify the exit code to confirm success vs. failure.
- **Best fit:** Medium/high reasoning jobs, long analyses, and orchestrations that require stable filenames for later automation.

## Workflow Patterns
- **Quick fixes / short edits:** Run `codex-exec.sh` synchronously.
- **Research with citations:** Use `codex-research.sh` and review the generated Markdown report.
- **Long-running or parallel jobs:** Prefer `codex-worker-launcher.sh` so each worker produces a timestamped log tagged with a PID.
- **Parallel execution:** Launch multiple Codex runs (`codex exec ... &` or several worker launchers) and `wait` for completion when you need synchronization.
- **Manual background management:** If you background `codex exec` or `codex-exec.sh` directly, record the job ID and only check in when required to avoid unnecessary polling.

## Best Practices & Safety Checklist
- Match reasoning effort to task size: keep `minimal/low` tasks in the foreground, consider backgrounding for `medium`, and default to backgrounding for `high`.
- After starting any background job, pause monitoring until someone explicitly asks for status to reduce noise and resource churn.
- Inspect exit codes for every completed job (0 = success, non-zero = failure) and review diffs before committing file changes.
- Scope Codex's accessible directories wherever possible, especially for sensitive repositories.
- Treat all generated artifacts as untrusted until you audit them.

## Verified Capabilities
- âœ… Non-interactive `codex exec` flows
- âœ… Automated code modifications (including git patches)
- âœ… Unit tests, API endpoints, and large-scale refactors
- âœ… Structured research reports with plain-URL citations
- âœ… Parallel or long-running workers with PID-tagged logs

## New Utility Scripts

### `codex-status.sh`
- **Role:** Job monitoring dashboard for all Codex tasks.
- **Usage:** `./codex-status.sh [options]`
- **Features:**
  - View all running and completed jobs
  - Filter by type (workers, research)
  - Show statistics (file count, disk usage)
  - Display job age and size information
- **Options:** `--all`, `--workers`, `--research`, `--latest N`, `--stats`

### `codex-cleanup.sh`
- **Role:** Automated cleanup and maintenance utility.
- **Usage:** `./codex-cleanup.sh [options]`
- **Features:**
  - Delete old files (default: 7+ days)
  - Compress aging files (3+ days)
  - Storage statistics and analysis
  - Dry-run mode for safety
- **Options:** `--dry-run`, `--age DAYS`, `--compress-only`, `--stats`, `--force`

## Configuration System

### `codex.yaml`
Optional configuration file for reference (not actively used by scripts):
```yaml
default_reasoning: low
output_dir: .mahirolab
auto_cleanup:
  enabled: true
  max_age_days: 7
workers:
  max_parallel: 3
  timeout_seconds: 600
```

Scripts use hardcoded defaults for simplicity. Modify individual scripts directly for custom settings.

## Communication Protocol

For efficient collaboration between User and Claude, use **Shortcodes** defined in [docs/SHORTCODES.md](docs/SHORTCODES.md):

- **`ccc`** - Create context & compact conversation
- **`nnn`** - Smart planning (auto-runs ccc if needed)
- **`gogogo`** - Execute most recent plan
- **`rrr`** - Create session retrospective
- **`lll`** - List project status

These shortcodes enable quick, consistent workflow management without verbose instructions. All state files are stored in `.mahirolab/state/` for persistence across sessions.
